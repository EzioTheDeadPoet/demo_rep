# WIP
TLDR used for demo. Will be fully expanded with documentation before it is potentially implemented. 

Create an "Issue" to:
- Request Featured Status for a modlist.
- Report a major unaddressed issue with an existing featured list
- Report a Wabbajack license or asset distribution violation with a modlist.

Best way for you to see how it works is to click through and look at the templates. We have created filled in examples (See issues) to show how it works in action
